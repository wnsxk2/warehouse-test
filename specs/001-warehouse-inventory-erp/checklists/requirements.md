# Specification Quality Checklist: Warehouse Inventory ERP System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Content Quality Assessment

- **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on what and why, not how. No mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches.
- **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate business value and user needs. Dashboard overview (P1) addresses primary use case.
- **Stakeholder-friendly**: Language is business-oriented, avoiding technical jargon. Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format familiar to business analysts.
- **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete. Made reasonable assumptions documented in Assumptions section.
- **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-025) is verifiable and specific.
- **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentage, count).
- **Technology-agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not system internals. Examples:
  - SC-001: "within 3 seconds" (not "API responds in 200ms")
  - SC-009: "50 concurrent users" (not "database handles 1000 TPS")
- **Complete scenarios**: Each of 5 user stories has 4-5 acceptance scenarios covering happy paths and error cases.
- **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases documented covering capacity, concurrency, validation, and error scenarios.
- **Clear scope**: Bounded to warehouse inventory management with transaction tracking. Excludes financial/procurement features.
- **Documented assumptions**: 8 assumptions documented covering authentication, data model, and behavior expectations.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- **Requirements with criteria**: All 25 functional requirements map to user scenarios with acceptance criteria.
- **Primary flow coverage**: User stories cover complete workflow from login → dashboard → warehouse management → item management → transaction tracking.
- **Success criteria alignment**: Measurable outcomes directly relate to user stories:
  - SC-001/SC-002: Performance targets for P1/P2 stories
  - SC-004/SC-006: Data integrity requirements
  - SC-008: Dashboard value proposition
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains technology-agnostic approach throughout.

## Notes

Specification is production-ready for `/speckit.plan` command. No further clarifications or revisions required before proceeding to technical planning phase.

**Strengths**:
- Well-prioritized user stories with clear MVP path (P1 → P2 → P3)
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all UI components mentioned in original description
- Strong edge case coverage anticipating real-world scenarios
- Clear entity model establishing data relationships

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (though clarification not needed)
