# Feature Specification: Warehouse Inventory ERP System

**Feature Branch**: `001-warehouse-inventory-erp`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "창고에 물건을 관리하고 반출입 이력을 확인하는 ERP 사이트를 제작할거야. 로그인을 하면 본인의 회사의 물품 관리 현황을 확인할 수 있어."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Dashboard Overview (Priority: P1)

As a warehouse manager, after logging into the system, I need to immediately see my company's current inventory status and recent transactions so I can quickly assess the warehouse situation without navigating through multiple pages.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary landing experience and provides the most critical at-a-glance information. Without this, users cannot quickly assess warehouse status, which is the core value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and verifying that inventory summary and recent transaction list are displayed correctly. Delivers immediate value by showing warehouse status overview.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a logged-in warehouse manager, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** I see current inventory statistics (total items, low stock alerts, warehouse utilization)
2. **Given** I am viewing the dashboard, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see the 10 most recent inbound/outbound transactions with timestamps and item details
3. **Given** inventory data exists, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** statistics update to reflect real-time inventory levels
4. **Given** there are low stock items, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see highlighted warnings for items below reorder threshold

### User Story 2 - Warehouse Management (Priority: P2)

As a warehouse manager, I need to view all warehouses managed by my company, see a preview of items in each warehouse, and add new warehouses, so I can organize inventory across multiple physical locations.

**Why this priority**: Multi-warehouse support is essential for companies with multiple storage facilities. This enables the core organizational structure of the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to warehouse management page, viewing warehouse list, checking item previews, and adding a new warehouse. Delivers value by enabling multi-location inventory organization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the warehouse management page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a list of all warehouses with basic information (name, location, capacity, current utilization)
2. **Given** I am viewing the warehouse list, **When** I click on a warehouse card, **Then** I see a preview of top items stored in that warehouse
3. **Given** I want to add a new warehouse, **When** I click "Add Warehouse" button, **Then** a modal opens with input fields for warehouse details
4. **Given** I have filled in warehouse details in the modal, **When** I submit the form, **Then** the new warehouse appears in the warehouse list
5. **Given** I submit incomplete warehouse information, **When** I try to save, **Then** I see validation error messages indicating which fields are required

### User Story 3 - Warehouse Detail and Item Assignment (Priority: P2)

As a warehouse manager, I need to view all items stored in a specific warehouse and assign items to that warehouse, so I can manage what inventory is kept at each location.

**Why this priority**: This complements User Story 2 by providing detailed warehouse-level inventory management. Essential for organizing items across locations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to a warehouse detail page, viewing the item list, and adding items to the warehouse. Delivers value by enabling detailed warehouse-level inventory control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on a warehouse detail page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a complete list of all items currently stored in that warehouse
2. **Given** I am viewing warehouse items, **When** I review the list, **Then** I see item details including name, quantity, category, and last updated date
3. **Given** I want to add an item to the warehouse, **When** I click "Add Item" button, **Then** a modal opens showing available items not yet assigned to this warehouse
4. **Given** I select an item and specify quantity in the modal, **When** I save, **Then** the item appears in the warehouse's item list with the specified quantity
5. **Given** I try to add more items than warehouse capacity allows, **When** I save, **Then** I see a warning about exceeding warehouse capacity

### User Story 4 - Transaction History Tracking (Priority: P3)

As a warehouse manager, I need to view all inbound and outbound transactions, filter them by type, and see detailed information about each transaction, so I can track inventory movements and maintain accurate records.

**Why this priority**: Essential for audit trails and understanding inventory movements, but the system can function for basic inventory management without detailed transaction history.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to transaction page, applying filters, viewing transaction list, and opening transaction details. Delivers value through complete movement tracking and audit capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the transaction history page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a list of all transactions sorted by most recent first
2. **Given** I want to see only specific transaction types, **When** I apply inbound or outbound filter, **Then** the list updates to show only matching transactions
3. **Given** I am viewing the transaction list, **When** I click on a transaction, **Then** a modal opens showing detailed information (item, quantity, date/time, warehouse, user who performed transaction, notes)
4. **Given** I need to find specific transactions, **When** I use date range filters, **Then** the list shows only transactions within the selected period
5. **Given** transaction history is empty, **When** I view the page, **Then** I see a helpful message indicating no transactions have been recorded yet

### User Story 5 - Item Master Data Management (Priority: P3)

As a warehouse manager, I need to view all registered items in the system and add new items with their details, so I can maintain a master catalog of items that can be tracked across warehouses.

**Why this priority**: While important for long-term system use, item management can initially be done through warehouse assignment. This is more about master data maintenance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to item management page, viewing the complete item list, and adding new items. Delivers value through centralized item catalog management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the item management page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a list of all items registered in the system with their basic information
2. **Given** I am viewing the item list, **When** I review items, **Then** I see item name, SKU/code, category, total quantity across all warehouses, and unit of measure
3. **Given** I want to register a new item, **When** I click "Register Item" button, **Then** a modal opens with input fields for item details
4. **Given** I have filled in item details, **When** I submit the form, **Then** the new item appears in the item list and becomes available for warehouse assignment
5. **Given** I try to register an item with a duplicate SKU/code, **When** I submit, **Then** I see an error message indicating the SKU already exists

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to assign more items to a warehouse than its capacity allows?
- How does the system handle concurrent transactions (two users trying to modify the same item quantity simultaneously)?
- What happens when a user tries to remove the last warehouse from the system?
- How does the system handle inbound transactions when the item doesn't exist in the system yet?
- What happens when a user tries to create an outbound transaction with insufficient inventory?
- How does the system handle deleted warehouses that have transaction history?
- What happens when filtering transactions by date ranges with no matching results?
- How does the system handle special characters or very long names in warehouse/item names?
