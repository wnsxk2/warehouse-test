# SDD Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality

Code MUST be maintainable, readable, and follow established best practices. Every contribution must adhere to:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module, class, and function has exactly one reason to change
- **DRY Principle**: No logic duplication; shared functionality must be abstracted appropriately
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Clear naming conventions that make intent obvious without comments
- **Consistent Style**: All code follows project linting rules and formatting standards
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing where available; type annotations required for public APIs

**Rationale**: Technical debt compounds exponentially. Preventing it at creation is 10x cheaper than fixing it later.

### II. Testing Standards

Testing is NON-NEGOTIABLE. All code changes require corresponding tests:

- **Test-First Development**: Tests written before implementation, verified to fail, then pass after implementation
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% unit test coverage, 70% integration test coverage
- **Test Independence**: Tests must run in isolation and in any order without side effects
- **Meaningful Assertions**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- **Contract Testing**: All public APIs and interfaces require contract tests

**Rationale**: Untested code is legacy code from day one. Tests are executable documentation proving correctness.

### III. User Experience Consistency

User-facing features MUST provide predictable, intuitive, and accessible experiences:

- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory for all UI components
- **Responsive Design**: Interfaces adapt gracefully across device sizes and capabilities
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with clear recovery paths
- **Loading States**: All async operations show appropriate loading indicators
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar tasks use similar interaction patterns

**Rationale**: Users judge quality by their experience. Inconsistency erodes trust and increases support costs.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Performance is a feature. All implementations must meet defined performance budgets:

- **Response Time**: API endpoints respond in <200ms (p95), UI interactions in <100ms
- **Resource Efficiency**: Memory usage profiled; no memory leaks tolerated
- **Scalability**: Systems designed to handle 10x current load without degradation
- **Optimization Required**: Performance profiling mandatory before production deployment
- **Monitoring**: All critical paths instrumented with performance metrics

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and operational costs. Optimization after deployment is 100x more expensive.

## Development Standards

### Code Review Process

- All changes require peer review before merge
- Reviewers verify compliance with all four core principles
- Performance implications assessed for critical paths
- Security considerations documented

### Documentation Requirements

- README updated for user-facing changes
- API contracts documented with examples
- Architecture decisions recorded (ADR format)
- User-facing documentation maintained alongside code

## Quality Gates

All pull requests must pass:

1. **Syntax & Type Checks**: Language-specific linting and type validation
2. **Test Suite**: All tests passing with coverage thresholds met
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: No regression in key performance metrics
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Automated and manual accessibility validation
5. **Code Review**: Peer approval with principle compliance verification

## Governance

This constitution establishes the minimum quality standards for the project. All contributors must:

- Read and understand these principles before contributing
- Verify compliance before submitting changes
- Challenge violations when observed in reviews
- Propose amendments via documented RFC process

**Amendment Process**: Constitution changes require:

1. Written proposal with rationale and impact analysis
2. Team discussion and consensus
3. Migration plan for existing violations
4. Documentation update and version bump

**Complexity Justification**: Any violation of simplicity principles (YAGNI, KISS) requires documented justification in the implementation plan's Complexity Tracking table.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-17 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-17
